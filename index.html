        <h3>Brain Tumor Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction from MRI data</h3>
        <p>This project seeks to expand and improve on existing methods for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. Manual tumor segmentation from trained medical professionals is costly and prone to human error or inconsistency. We are training a UNet-based segmentation model and 3D reconstruction and building visualization tool with the goal to automate the tedious task of segmentation and also help doctors better visualize patient tumors and make more informed decisions for treatment.</p>

        <h3>Active Aerodynamics of Morphing Camber</h3>
        <p>Changing the amount of camber, or curvature, present in an airfoil is a powerful means of controlling the forces and moments that it generates under fluid flow. Furthermore, the control authority provided is significant even if only a modest portion of the airfoil chord has the ability to change camber. Under this project, a study was made with the application for a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) to use the ability to dynamically change the blade camber with programmed servos to give max aerodynamic efficiency in different wind speeds.</p>
